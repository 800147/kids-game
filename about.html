        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I made this game for my three yaers old daughter that wanted to play
          some games but was not so familiar with game controller and could not
          handle with other games that challenges the player too soon.
        </p>

        <p>Main requirements for my game were as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Main character should be a dinosaur</li>
          <li>Game should be easy to play</li>
          <li>It shouldn't be possible to lose</li>
          <li>
            There should be a little (but still existing) growth of difficulty
          </li>
          <li>Gameplay should be endless</li>
          <li>
            Progress should be visible even for a person who does not yet know
            the numbers
          </li>
          <li>Game controller support</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And here is the solution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Main character is a dinosaur drawn by my beloved wife Maryam</li>
          <li>The goal is to collect apples by moving on a chess-like field</li>
          <li>No enemies or other dangerous stuff</li>
          <li>
            Stone wall appear on a random cell after each collected apple making
            the field looks more like a maze is process (special algorithm
            doesn't let the walls to block available cells completely)
          </li>
          <li>
            When there's no room left for another wall, field cleans up
            compleatly, saving all collected apples
          </li>
          <li>
            Collected apples are presented as a pile in the basket (wierd
            rectangular basket) so it is visually became more massive when more
            apples are collected
          </li>
          <li>Game controllers are supported as well as keyboard and touch</li>
        </ol>
